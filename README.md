# 🪐 Sci-Fi Rotation Effect – Figma Prototype
A sci-fiction inspired rotation effect created entirely in Figma, using motion, blur, and smart animate to bring a futuristic UI illusion to life.
This project explores interaction design, timing curves, and depth animation — turning static frames into a seamless motion loop.

## 🎬 Prototype Details
🔹 Interaction 1
Trigger: Click
Animation: Smart Animate
Curve: Ease In & Out
Duration: 500ms

🔹 Interaction 2
Trigger: After Delay
Delay: 1ms
Animation: Smart Animate
Curve: Slow
Duration: 600ms

## 🧩 Design Process
- Started with a base frame, duplicated it to create 6 animation frames.
- Applied blur and rotated the rectangles by –90°, 180°, –90° to generate a rotating effect.
- Linked all frames in a loop using prototype connections for continuous motion.
- Final result → a sci-fi rotation animation that feels dynamic, immersive, and futuristic.

## 🌟 What I Learned
- The power of motion timing and curve control in UI animation.
- How layer blur and rotation can simulate 3D movement in 2D space.
- Creative use of Smart Animate for smooth, cinematic transitions.
